## Introduction

Bopgun is a Ruby-based command-line interface (CLI) toolkit designed to assist with the initialization and testing of various language projects. It provides a domain-specific language (DSL) for parsing folder structures, SQL schemes, and other project-specific elements.

Whether you're starting a new Ruby, Python, JavaScript, or any other language project, Bopgun simplifies the setup process and ensures consistency across projects.
